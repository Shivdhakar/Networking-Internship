# Networking Internship Notes

## Day 1: Networking Basics
**What I Learned Today:**

**Networking?**  
Computers chatting! Like WhatsApp but for all devices  

**Main Parts:**  
- **Hardware:** Cables (wires), switches (traffic cop), routers (post office)  
- **Software:** Programs that say "Hey, send this message!"  

**Shapes (Topologies):**  
- **Star** - Everything plugs into one switch (my home WiFi router!)  
- **Bus** - Devices in straight line (old school)  
- **Ring** - Circle, message goes around (kinda weird)  
- **Mesh** - Everyone talks directly (super reliable but expensive)  

**Network Types:**  
- **PAN** - My phone + AirPods (1 meter range)  
- **LAN** - Office WiFi (whole building)  
- **MAN** - City WiFi hotspots  
- **WAN** - WHOLE INTERNET!  

**How Data Moves:**  
1. You click "Send"  
2. Data packet travels through cables  
3. Router says "Which way?"  
4. Reaches friend!  

**Problems I Might Face:**  
- **Hackers** - Stealing passwords  
- **Viruses** - Mess up your files  
- **Slow Speed** - Too many people downloading movies  
- **Connection Drops** - WiFi signal weak  

*Day 1 Done! Networking = devices talking. Easy!*

## Day 2: LAN vs WAN + Design Time  
**Quick Diff:**  
- **LAN** = Small area (my room to kitchen)  
- **MAN** = Medium (whole college campus)  
- **WAN** = HUGE (India to USA)  

**My Real Company Scenario:**  
**EduTech Solutions** (education app company)  
- **Main Office:** 100 employees, downtown (needs fast LAN)  
- **Dev Center:** 50 coders, 5km away (fiber cable connection?)  
- **3 Sales Offices:** Across state (WAN links needed)  
- **25 Home Workers:** Need VPN to connect safely  

**My Plan:**  
1. Main office = Star topology + Gigabit switches  
2. Dev center = Connect with leased line (fast internet)  
3. Sales offices = VPN tunnels  
4. Home workers = Company VPN app  

**Challenges:**  
- How to keep video calls smooth?  
- What if sales guy loses laptop?  
- Home internet slow sometimes...  

*Gonna draw network diagram tomorrow!*

## Day 3: MAC & IP Addresses (Finally Gets It!)  
**MAC Address:**  
- Device's **real name** burned into hardware  
- Example: `A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6` (6 pairs)  
- Only works in **same room** (LAN)  
- Can't change it! Permanent ID card  

**IP Address:**  
- Device's **internet name** (can change)  
- Example: `192.168.1.10` (4 numbers)  
- Works **anywhere** online  
- Router gives it automatically (DHCP)  

**How They Team Up:**  
1. You email friend: "Send to IP 8.8.8.8"  
2. Router asks: "ARP, who's MAC for this IP?"  
3. ARP replies: "It's AA:BB:CC!"  
4. Data goes: IP (outside) â†’ MAC (inside room)  

**IP Types:**  
| Type | Example | Where? |  
|------|---------|--------|  
| **Public** | 8.8.8.8 | Internet |  
| **Private** | 192.168.1.1 | Home WiFi |  

**My Home Setup EXACTLY:**  
1. Jio gives router: Public IP `203.XX.XX.XX`  
2. Router gives my phone: Private `192.168.1.5`  
3. NAT = Magic translator (hides my private IP)  
4. I browse YouTube safely!   

**What If No Private IPs?**  
- 8 billion devices fighting for 4 billion addresses = **CRASH!**  
- No security, hackers see everything  
- Internet = Total mess   

**Quick Test:** My phone MAC? `E8:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`  
My IP? `192.168.0.105` (just checked!)  

*Day 3 = IPs = House address, MAC = Room number. GOT IT!*
