#  Networking Notes â€“ DHCP, NTP & 3-Way Handshake

---

##  DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- DHCP gives **IP addresses automatically** to devices in a network.  
- No need to set IP manually.  
- Works on **UDP port 67 (Server)** and **UDP port 68 (Client)**.

###  Steps â€“ DORA Process

1. **Discover** â†’ Client sends message to find DHCP Server.  
2. **Offer** â†’ Server offers an IP address.  
3. **Request** â†’ Client asks to use that IP.  
4. **Acknowledge** â†’ Server confirms and assigns IP.

Example:  
Client gets IP `192.168.1.10` automatically.

### ðŸ§¾ DHCP Gives:
- IP Address  
- Subnet Mask  
- Default Gateway  
- DNS Server  
- Lease Time

##  NTP (Network Time Protocol)

- NTP is used to **synchronize time** between all computers.  
- It works on **UDP port 123**.  
- It **does not use 3-way handshake** because it uses UDP.

###  How It Works:
1. Client sends request with its current time.  
2. Server replies with accurate time.  
3. Client adjusts its clock using the time difference.

Used for keeping all systemsâ€™ clocks the same.

## TCP 3-Way Handshake

- Used to **start a reliable connection** between two devices.  
- Works on **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**.

###  Steps:
1. **SYN** â†’ Client: "Hello, I want to connect."  
2. **SYN-ACK** â†’ Server: "Okay, Iâ€™m ready."  
3. **ACK** â†’ Client: "Letâ€™s start communication."

After this, data transfer begins.

## Summary Table

| Protocol | Use | Port | Type | Steps |
|-----------|-----|------|------|-------|
| **DHCP** | Gives IP automatically | UDP 67, 68 | Connectionless | DORA (4 steps) |
| **NTP** | Time synchronization | UDP 123 | Connectionless | Time exchange |
| **TCP (3-Way Handshake)** | Start connection | TCP | Connection-oriented | SYN â†’ SYN-ACK â†’ ACK |

**Tip:**  
Remember â€”  
- DHCP â†’ IP auto assign  
- NTP â†’ Time sync  
- TCP Handshake â†’ Start connection
