#  Day 4 - Week 2: OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

The **OSI Model** is a conceptual framework used to standardize how different networking systems communicate. It divides the network communication process into **7 layers**, where each layer performs a specific role in handling and transmitting data across a network.


## The 7 Layers of the OSI Model


### Physical Layer  
- Deals with **hardware components** and the **physical transmission** of raw data (bits: 0s and 1s).  
- Includes cables, connectors, and transmission mediums.  
- **Examples:** Ethernet cables, Hubs.


###  Data Link Layer  
- Ensures **error-free transfer** of data frames between two directly connected devices.  
- Handles **MAC addressing** and frame synchronization.  
- **Examples:** Network Switches, Bridges.


###  Network Layer  
- Responsible for **logical addressing** and **routing** of packets across networks.  
- Decides the **best path** for data to reach its destination.  
- **Examples:** Routers, IPv4, IPv6.


###  Transport Layer  
- Provides **reliable or unreliable delivery** of data using protocols like **TCP** or **UDP**.  
- Handles **segmentation**, **flow control**, and **error detection/recovery**.  
- **Examples:** TCP, UDP.


###  Session Layer  
- Establishes, manages, and terminates **sessions** between two applications.  
- Supports **dialog control**, keeping data streams organized.  
- **Examples:** APIs, Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).


###  Presentation Layer  
- Translates data between the **application** and the **network format**.  
- Performs **encryption**, **decryption**, and **compression**.  
- **Examples:** SSL/TLS, JPEG, MP3.


###  Application Layer  
- Closest to the **end user**.  
- Provides **network services** like web browsing, email, and file transfer.  
- **Examples:** HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.


##  Summary Table

| Layer | Name             | Function                            | Examples               |
|-------|------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 7     | Application       | User services                       | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS   |
| 6     | Presentation      | Translation, encryption, compression| SSL/TLS, JPEG, MP3     |
| 5     | Session           | Session management                  | APIs, RPC              |
| 4     | Transport         | Reliable data delivery              | TCP, UDP               |
| 3     | Network           | Logical addressing, routing         | IP, Routers            |
| 2     | Data Link         | Frame transfer, MAC addressing      | Switches, Bridges      |
| 1     | Physical          | Hardware, bit transmission          | Ethernet, Hubs         |







## ‚úâÔ∏è Example  (Short): Sending an Email Using Outlook ‚Äì OSI Layers

A quick look at how the OSI Model works when you send an email using Outlook.

| Layer | Name         | What Happens                                    | Examples                  |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 7     | Application   | Outlook uses SMTP to send email                 | SMTP, IMAP, POP3          |
| 6     | Presentation  | Email & attachments encoded/encrypted           | SSL/TLS, Base64           |
| 5     | Session       | Session opened with the mail server             | NetBIOS, RPC              |
| 4     | Transport     | Data broken into segments, sent reliably        | TCP                       |
| 3     | Network       | Email routed via IP to destination server       | IP, ICMP                  |
| 2     | Data Link     | Frames sent between local devices (MAC address) | Ethernet, MAC             |
| 1     | Physical      | Bits sent via cable or Wi-Fi                    | Cables, Wi-Fi, NIC        |

üìå **Summary:** Sending an email uses **all 7 OSI layers**, from writing the message (Layer 7) to transmitting data bits (Layer 1).
