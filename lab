# VLAN Configuration on a Single Switch

## Step 1: Enter Switch Configuration Mode
To start configuration, first enter privileged and global configuration mode.

## Step 2: Create VLANs
Now create VLANs and give them proper names.

## Step 3: Assign VLANs to Ports
Assign each VLAN to specific ports on the switch.

## Step 4: Verify VLANs
After configuration, check VLAN details using the command below.

- VLAN 10 → **Sales** (assigned to port Fa0/1)  
- VLAN 20 → **Marketing** (assigned to port Fa0/2)  
- Command `show vlan brief` helps verify VLAN creation and port assignment.
