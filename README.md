# 🚀 Networking Internship Documentation

Welcome to my **Networking-Internship** repository!  
This repo contains all my learning work, lab practice, weekly notes, commands, and diagrams from my networking internship and self-practice journey.

The goal of this repo is to track my progress, build a networking knowledge base, and help others who want to learn networking with hands-on labs and real-time notes.
